	As a result of the caste system many landlords in India, own large amounts of land and have bonded laborers from the untouchable caste working for them. This practice has been ongoing for centuries. These so-called ‘untouchables’ are treated as slaves.
	</p>
	<p>
	The film Boundless Land is a portrait of Krishnammal Jagannathan an 89-year-old Gandhian. She non-violently fights for the liberation of landless bonded laborers and the so-called ‘untouchables’ in Tamil Nadu, India. With the help of private donors and government subsidies she procures the land from the landlords and holds it in a trust under her name. The next step is coordinating with the government officials working through all inefficiencies and corruption it comes with. The challenging part of Krishnammal’s mission is mobilizing and coordinating the landless poor. It takes multiple days to navigate various government offices and complete the required paperwork needed to transfer land successfully. This means numerous days of lost wages. Krishnammal transfers the land to the women in the family as it is her mission to liberate women.

	In 1947, Krishnammal, participated in India’s freedom struggle against the British Empire. During the struggle when Gandhi visited Madhurai, Tamil Nadu she was in charge of guarding his tent. Vinobha Bhave a freedom fighter also known as Gandhi’s spiritual advisor started the Bhoodhan Movement post independence. This was a non-violent movement that focused on the redistribution of land from landlords to the landless poor and bonded laborers. He marched from the North of India to the south convince landlords to donate a portion of their land to bonded and landless laborers. Krishnammal non-violently marched along side Vinobha Bhave as his disciple for the cause.

	Krishnammal later took the movement to Tamil Nadu and founded Land for the Tillers’ Freedom (LAFTI). She would sit outside the landlord’s home for many weeks at a time refusing to move until the landlord agreed to give a sixth of his land to the untouchable laborers who worked on his land. She survived several dangerous situations such as when she encountered tigers in the jungles of Bihar while fleeing the murderous threat of a landlord.  Once a landlord threatened to release his pet tiger on her as she was sitting outside his home she responded: "That's alright, I've dealt with tigers before".
